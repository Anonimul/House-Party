# House-Party
This is a repo for storing version and stories of House Party, a game by Eek! Games.

Switch to the branch that you intend to play with, then copy the whole House Party folder to the location C:\Users\{Your Own User Name}\Documents\Eek

Btw, censorship is removed.

This branch includes all the custom stories I found on the Eek! Games forum. I do not own them nor make them.
